          <p class="importance-text">Exposure to STEM education gives you skills that make you more employable and ready to meet the current labor demand. In addition to that, it also gives you the wide range of experiences and skills you will need to succeed in life. It helps you become better at research and critical thinking which you can then use to solve various problems that are going on around the world. For example, think about how the alternative sources of energies were made- they were made by innovative people that pursued STEM. Or TESLA, which transitions our world to sustainable energy in order to create less pollution. All in all, science is everywhere in the world around us, and pervades every part of our lives. For this reason, we encourage young women to pursue STEM-related fields as it carries a large impact and a great significance.</p>
